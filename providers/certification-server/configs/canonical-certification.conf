welcome_text = Welcome to System Certification!

 This application will gather information from your system. Then you will be asked manual tests to confirm that the system is working properly. Finally, you will be asked for the Secure ID of the computer to submit the information to the certification.canonical.com database.

 Please be sure you have edited /etc/xdg/canonical-certification.conf as necessary to set your Secure ID, and network and virtualization test parameters.

 To learn how to create or locate the Secure ID, please see here:

 https://certification.canonical.com/home/ubuntu-certified

# If you have a secure_id, uncomment the next two lines and set your
# 15- or 18-character secure_id here for automatic submission. If
# unsure, it's safe to leave this commented out.

# For virtualization testing:
#
# KVM_TIMEOUT sets the timeout to wait for the cloudimg to boot before exiting
# test. It is an integer in seconds (the default is 3000 seconds)
# KVM_IMAGE the location to find the cloud image to use for testing KVM.  This
# will allow you to specify a variety of location options depending on your
# needs.  
# Options available:
#  - http://myserver.com/imagedir/ (note the trailing / is required!!)
#    - This will tell the script to look into /imagedir/ on the remote server
#      for files in the standard ubuntu Cloud filename format
#      RELEASE-server-cloudimg-ARCH-disk1.img
#  - http://someotherserver.net/imagedir/ubuntu/mycloudimg.img
#    - This will tell the script to download the file mycloudimg.img from the
#      remote server.
#  - file:///local/path/to/cloud.img
#    - This will tell the script to look at the path specified on the local
#      filesystem for a copy of the cloud image to use.
#  - /local/path/to/cloud.img
#    - This will work the same as the file:// example above and should be a
#      full path to the cloud image.
#
# UNCOMMENT EITHER OR BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING 2 LINES and set the proper
# parameters as necessary:
#KVM_TIMEOUT = 300
#KVM_IMAGE = /path/to/cloudimage-filename.img

# For LXD testing:
#
# LXD_ROOTFS is the tarall that contains the pre-created root filesystem for 
# LXD containers.
# LXD_TEMPLATES is the tarball that contains the LXD templates and YAML
# necessary for defining containers
#LXD_ROOTFS = http://server_url/path/to/lxd-rootfs-filename.tar.xz
#LXD_TEMPLATE = http://server_url/path/to/lxd-templates-filename.tar.xz

# For network testing:
#
# TEST_TARGET_IPERF is the IP/Hostname of the iperf server for network testing.
#
# UNCOMMENT THE FOLLOWING LINE and set the proper parameters as necessary:
#TEST_TARGET_IPERF =  your-iperf-server.example.com
